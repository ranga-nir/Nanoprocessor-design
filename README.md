1. Execute Simple Programs Using a 4-bit Processor
   The primary goal is to run simple programs and obtain results using a custom-designed 4-bit processor capable of executing 8 basic instructions.
2. Develop a 4-bit Arithmetic Unit
   A core component of the processor is a 4-bit arithmetic unit designed to perform both addition and subtraction on signed integers efficiently.
3. Implement Instruction Decoding
   To correctly execute instructions, an Instruction Decoder is developed to activate the appropriate internal components of the processor based on the input operation.
4. Design Multiplexers or Tri-State Buses
   k-way, b-bit multiplexers and/or tri-state buses are designed to manage data flow and control signal selection throughout the processor architecture.
5. Simulate and Test for Verification
   Once design and development are completed, all components are thoroughly tested through simulations and validated on a development board to ensure proper functionality.
